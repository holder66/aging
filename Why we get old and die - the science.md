#### sperm competition
Once mating has occurred, the millions of sperm compete with each other to be first to reach the oocyte[2]. In species in which females mate in rapid succession with a variety of males, the sperm race helps select between individuals. Here is a video of that process in the fruit fly. The sperm of one male have been labelled with a green fluorescence, and the sperm of a second male labelled with red, which unfortunately is barely visible <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>


Fluorescent sperm in the female sperm-storage organ of Drosophila melanogaster
Sperm competition occurs after females mate with multiple males whose sperm compete for fertilizations within the female reproductive tract. Our understanding of events during sperm competition has been constrained by the challenge of directly observing sperm behavior and fate inside the female and the inability to differentiate sperm from multiple males. This image shows the primary sperm-storage organ (seminal receptacle) of a female Drosophila melanogaster that has mated to transgenic males with green (first male) or red (second male) fluorescently-labeled sperm heads. Sperm competition mechanisms elucidated by these novel transgenics include active sperm motility, sperm displacement and female ejection.
